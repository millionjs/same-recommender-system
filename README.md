Search and recommendation system engineering.
1) Recall. 
2) Rough ranking. 
3) Fine ranking. 
4) Strategy.

# 🧠 Search and Recommendation System Engineering

A typical search or recommendation system pipeline is composed of four major stages:

1. **Recall (Candidate Generation)**
2. **Rough Ranking (Pre-Ranking)**
3. **Fine Ranking**
4. **Strategy Layer (Post-Ranking / Business Logic)**

Each stage serves a specific purpose in filtering, scoring, and personalizing results from a massive item corpus to deliver a small set of relevant items to the user.

## 1. 🔍 Recall (Candidate Generation)

### ✅ Objective:
Quickly retrieve a manageable number of potentially relevant items from a large dataset.

### ⚙️ Key Characteristics:
- Fast and scalable
- Returns hundreds to thousands of candidates
- Trade-off between recall quality and computational cost

### 🛠️ Techniques:
- Collaborative Filtering (user/item-based)
- Content-Based Filtering
- Embedding Matching (e.g., vector similarity)
- Matrix Factorization
- Knowledge-based Filters (rules)
- Deep Retrieval Models (Dual-tower architectures like DSSM)
- Hybrid Recall (combine multiple strategies)

### 📊 Evaluation Metrics:
- Precision@K
- Recall@K
- Hit Rate
- Mean Average Precision (MAP)

## 2. 🔄 Rough Ranking (Coarse Ranking / Pre-Ranking)

### ✅ Objective:
Reduce candidate pool size efficiently while maintaining relevance signal.

### ⚙️ Key Characteristics:
- Faster than fine ranking
- Simpler models
- Prepares data for final ranking

### 🛠️ Techniques:
- Feature Selection & Reduction
- Lightweight Models: Linear models, LightGBM, small MLPs
- Simplified Two-Tower Architectures
- Model Distillation
- Heuristic Rules

### 🎯 Optimization Goals:
- Speed and efficiency
- Maintain high relevance
- Reduce load on downstream components

## 3. 🔍 Fine Ranking

### ✅ Objective:
Accurately rank top candidates using sophisticated models and deep learning.

### ⚙️ Key Characteristics:
- High-quality predictions
- Expensive computation
- Rich feature set with cross-interactions

### 🛠️ Techniques:
- **Learning to Rank (LTR)**:
    - Pointwise, Pairwise, Listwise approaches
- **Deep Learning Models**:
    - Wide & Deep
    - DIN / DIEN (for sequential behavior)
    - Transformer-based models
    - Multi-task Learning (CTR, CVR, dwell time)
- **Contextual Features**:
    - User context (device, location, time)
    - Item context (price, popularity, freshness)
    - Session context (recent interactions)
- **User Behavior Modeling**:
    - Click-through rate (CTR)
    - Conversion rate (CVR)
    - Watch time, engagement duration

### 📊 Evaluation Metrics:
- AUC
- Log Loss
- NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)
- CTR/CVR lift via A/B tests

---

## 4. 🎯 Strategy Layer (Post-Ranking / Business Logic)

### ✅ Objective:
Apply business goals, constraints, and diversity to the final ranked list before serving.

### ⚙️ Key Considerations:
- Balance relevance with business objectives
- Ensure fairness, diversity, novelty
- Control exposure for policy compliance

### 🛠️ Components:
- **Diversity Control**: MMR, bandits, RL
- **Debiasing**: Position bias correction, score calibration
- **Business Rules**:
    - Boost sponsored items
    - Enforce inventory limits
    - Limit repeated items
- **Fairness & Ethics**:
    - Equitable treatment across groups
    - Content moderation integration
- **A/B Testing Integration**:
    - Track KPIs: revenue, retention, satisfaction

### 📈 Techniques:
- Bandit algorithms
- Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- Rule engines
- Post-processing filters and re-ranking
